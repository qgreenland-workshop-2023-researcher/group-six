Associate paper for dataset: Messager, M.L., Lehner, B., Grill, G., Nedeva, I., Schmitt, O. (2016). Estimating the volume and age of water stored in global lakes using a geo-statistical approach. Nature Communications, 7: 13603. https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms13603

## Data Description

We have chosen the HydroLAKES dataset, which provides the shoreline polygons of all global lakes with a surface area of at least 10 ha. HydroLAKES only includes a limited amount of (mostly geometric) attribute information, such as: 
- Surface area
- Shoreline length
- Estimates of average depth
- Water volume
- Residence time

We clipped the dataset to Greenland's boundaries to reduce its size.
